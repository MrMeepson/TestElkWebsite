            <h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>
            <h3>PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE</h3>
            <p>The Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks of the United States of America was organized in New York City on February 16, 1868 by a group of 15 men with mutual interests, who identified themselves as “members of the theatrical, minstrel, musical, equestrian and literary professions and others who sympathized with and support the object in view”.</p>
            <p>The central figure of this group and the man who is recognized as the founder of the Order was Charles Algernon Sidney Vivian, the son of an English clergyman.  Having scored his success in London music halls, Vivian came to this country to try his fortune and a few months later initiated the movement that resulted in the formation of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks.</p>
            <p>Declared purposes of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks were then, and still are, to practice its  four cardinal virtues, Charity, Justice, Brotherly Love and Fidelity; to promote the welfare and enhance the happiness of its members; to quicken the spirit of American patriotism; and to cultivate good fellowship.</p>
            <p>The animal from which the Order derives its name was selected because of its many admirable attributes.  The elk is distinctly an American animal.  It is fleet of foot and graceful in movement, quick and keen of perception and, while usually gentle, an elk is strong and valiant in defense of its own.</p>
            <p>Today the Elks are one of the largest philanthropic organizations in the world.  The Elks National Foundation (ENF) was established in 1928 to “unite the forces of the Order into a mighty army for the service of mankind”.  Since inception the ENF has contributed more than $500 million towards Elks charitable projects nationwide.  The Foundation’s budget for the 2020 – 2021 fiscal year totals $36.1 million including:</p>

            <p>Locally, the Lake Norman Elks Lodge, through the generosity of the ENF, the North Carolina State Elks Association and its own members contributed more than $20,000 to the community including one $4,000 scholarship winner in the last fiscal year.  This year we will contribute even more.  Our projects  include support of Angels & Sparrow Soup Kitchen in Huntersville and the Ada Jenkins Center in Davidson, the ENF Scholarship and Hoop Shoot Programs, and, providing Welcome Home Kits to veterans who were previously homeless and are now moving into a new residence.  The Lodge also supports the Hope House Foundation in Huntersville.</p>
            <p>Elks care, Elks share.  Yet, we are also a fraternal organization.  Lake Norman Elks get together and socialize throughout the year.</p>
            <p>Lake Norman Elks Lodge #392, formerly Charlotte Lodge #392, was founded on November 17, 1897.  Our first Exalted Ruler was B. Swift Davis.  Charlotte / Mecklenburg Lodge #2631 was founded on September 20, 1981 and merged with Charlotte Lodge #392 in 1992.</p>
            <p>Lake Norman Elks Lodge has a rich history of community service.</p>
            <p>Some highlights from the past and present include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A new Cadillac was first prize in a raffle for Cerebral Palsy held in 1954.</li>
                <li>One year the Lodge sponsored 32 boys for the Elks Boys Camp.  The North Carolina State Elks Association (NCSEA) no longer has a summer camp.  However, in keeping with that tradition, the NCSEA is now a principal sponsor of Camp Carefree near Stokesdale, which provides summer one-week camp experiences for children with chronic illnesses and disabilities.</li>
                <li>Lake Norman (Charlotte) Elks Lodge has sponsored Little League and youth basketball teams.  Today, we sponsor an annual Hoop Shoot Contest for children ages 8 – 13.  Each year the names of the six national champions are inscribed in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. </li>
                <li>Over the years, the Lodge has sponsored Christmas parties for children and seniors.  We have partnered with Santa Claus and his Elves to bring Christmas cheer to children hospitalized with serious illnesses and to seniors in rehab.</li>
                <li>Lake Norman Lodge supports our veterans.  We have sponsored bingo games for patients at the Salisbury VA Hospital.  Our NCSEA provides handicapped accessible vans for each of the VA hospitals in North Carolina for transportation of their patients and has purchased TVs for every room of the veterans’ homes in NC.  In partnership with the Elks National Veterans Service Association, in the last 18 months we have purchased over 60 Welcome Home Kits for previously homeless veterans in the Charlotte area who moved into new residences.   Theses Welcome Home Kits consist of about $300 in household items, such as dishes, pots and pans, towels, small appliances, etc.</li>
                <li>Each year Lake Norman Elks hold a Flag Day ceremony.  The Elks were the first national fraternal organization to recognize Flag Day and to require performance of Flag Day ceremonies by its lodges.  Lake Norman Elks have performed Flag Day ceremonies at Charlotte Knights baseball games and at a Charlotte Checkers hockey game.  More recently, we have performed the ceremony at the Davidson Farmers Market assisted by a local JROTC chapter.</li>
                <li>In 2021 the Elks National Foundation will award 500 four-year scholarships based on academics, leadership, and financial need. National awards range from $1,000 per year to $12,500 per year.   In 2020 the Lake Norman Elks had a National scholarship winner of $1,000 per year for four years.  Additionally, the North Carolina State Elks Association provides 40 one-year scholarship awards of $1,000.  The Lake Norman Elks regularly have winners of $1,000 scholarship awards.</li>
                <li>Lake Norman Elks support local charitable organizations, including Angels & Sparrows Soup Kitchen, Ada Jenkins Center and Hope House.  Angels & Sparrows provides lunches free of charge to those in need in the Huntersville area.  The Ada Jenkins Center supports low income families in Davidson and Hope House provides temporary housing and support services to women experiencing situational homelessness.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Also, of historical note are some events held in the past to honor sports heroes.   On January 23, 1971, the Charlotte Elks hosted a “Big Leaguers Night” banquet honoring North and South Carolina baseball players, coaches, umpires, scouts, managers, sportscasters, and others.  Guests were welcomed by Frank H. Lewis, Exalted Ruler Charlotte Elks Lodge.  Coaches and umpires honored included: George Whitfield, Earl Smith, Joe Ferebee, Walter Rabb, Chuck Hartmann, Bill Wilhelm, Clyde King, Dick Williams, Jimmy Odom, and Harry Odom.  Among the special honorees was Tommy Helms, Cincinnati Reds Second Baseman and National League Gold Glove winner.  The keynote speaker was The Honorable Wilmer “Vinigar Bend” Mizell, U.S. Representative, Fifth Congressional District.  He was introduced by Charlotte Mayor, Honorable John Belk.  Special guest at the following year’s banquet was the Cincinnati Reds legend, Pete Rose.</p>
            <p>The Charlotte Lodge held a dance at our former River Club to honor Jack Dempsey, former heavyweight boxing champion of the world.</p>
            <p>Lake Norman Elks Lodge is proud of our continuing commitment to community service and community spirit.  We are committed to providing high quality services to the greater Charlotte area in general and to the Lake Norman area in particular.   </p>
